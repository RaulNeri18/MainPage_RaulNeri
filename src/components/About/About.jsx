                <h3>UX + UI + FRONTEND =&gt; UX ENGINEER</h3>
                <p>Hi, I&apos;m Eve - UI/UX designer and front-end developer. I am experienced in creating design concepts, style guides and design systems. I collect user feedback, through interviews, live A/B testing and user tracking, to identify the deeper issues behind conversion gaps and unreached KPIs. I am fast and effective at creating user personas, user flowcharts, storyboards, wireframes, mockups and interactive prototypes to make the potential of new products or UI/UX improvements visible to the team. I develop live JavaScript component libraries with state documentation to increase the velocity of the development team.  In my spare time, I combine tech with growing open-pollinated vegetable varieties in my “hackergarden” for seed saving projects.</p>
